### <img src="images/icons/report.png" alt=" " width="40" height="40" > Executive Summary

The Covid-19 Pandemic has highlighted challenges in getting immediate access to ventilators or resuscitators especially for patients needing to be transported between medical facilities while experiencing hypoxia. 
We learnt from our Stakeholders, doctors in Gujarat, India that in such scenarios the patient is manually ventilated using a BVM by ambulance personnel. These medical personnel can often be understaffed and overworked. Pumping a BVM for journeys of upto an hour pulls them away from other aspects of critical patient care, increasing fatigue and chances of  human error. 
We as a team decided to tackle this challenge by designing an automated BVM pumping mechanism that is cost-effective, compact, lightweight and robust. As strong advocates for echo-sustainability we were motivated to devise a solution which could reuse a lot of existing technology. Hence, the design showcased below will be an automated version of pre-existing and readily available medical resources with better assistive and failure detection features, making it a creative bio-tech solution. 
Initially, leading up to the MVP after rigorous research and discussions with our Stakeholders we decided to attempt a solution which was similar to the ones tested in the industry, aka a motor driven pumping mechanism. We implemented this by refurbishing an unused 3D printer but we realized that the structure was quite bulky, intrusive, more suitable for bedside use, unable to compress the BVM sufficiently. We also found that most  of the other potential solutions were built around this mechanism. For our final product, we wanted the design to add minimal structural overhead and spatial inconvenience to the paramedics, patients and accompanying kin. 
On exploring different design avenues, keeping our requirements in mind, we deduced that the Pneumatic Design was the best fit for our use case. We consulted with different industry experts who suggested Festo as the leading manufactures in the field. This design choice helped us make a unique, eco-friendly, portable and a compact design such that it could be easily embedded in an ambulance environment.
<h3> So what does our Product Do? </h3>
Our product as-is meets all the criterias that we set out to achieve, they were decided on the basis of extensive research and stakeholder feedback. While remodeling our MVP design the following goals and requirements were concluded upon for the final product:
<ul>
  <li>
Readily Sourced and Repairable: Each component used in making the automation mechanism is easily detachable and replaceable. The product facilitates manual pumping incase of a failure as a result of the aforementioned attributes. Most of our components have a Matrix Code which upon scanning directs the user to technical documentation corresponding to that component. The air tubing used can be detached from push in fittings by pressing down on them, allowing for modification in their length and substitution.
</li>
<li>
No damage to the BVM: There is little to no scope of damaging the BVM by implementing our design as it accounts for a cushioning material placed on the piston end (by adding a sponge for the current design and a cushion to the metallic concave plate). The direction of motion in which the bag is mechanically pushed is in line with it’s orientation and the axis of the arm that it’s mounted on. 
Programmable: Our pumping mechanism is driven by an easily programmable microcontroller(Raspberry Pi) which gives us the ability to adjust or modify the pump rate as required (pump rate is usually constant across patients experiencing hypoxia as mentioned by our stakeholder). We are currently pumping the bag at 14 breaths/min which is the average desired pump rate. The PLC also reads sensor data and transmits it to the target medical facility as described by Siddharth Bhardwaj in his piece. (Link Sid’s work here)
Affordable: As we are reusing readily available pre-existing mechanisms, we have reduced the overall cost of the automating aspects of our device. Furthermore, most medical centres (including small remote ones) and ambulances carry BVMs on-site, in our target communities. Ambulances tend to have inbuilt air compressors onboard which simplifies the installation of our design further and makes it more cost effective. 
</li>
<li>
Power Requirement: Currently our system draws 24V*0.067A = 1.608W when the piston is extended and 24*0.005= 0.12W when retracted. This is sufficient power to compress the BVM all the way if a minimum pressure of 30 psi is provided.
</li>
<li>
Sustainable design: The global pandemic brought about some unique component procurement challenges to light for our team. Due to the inaccessibility of the electronics labs and machine shop we had to struggle a lot while trying to complete the simplest of tasks at home. This presented an opportunity for the team to actively think of repurposing certain components like a cardboard holder fashioned to mount the pneumatic cylinder, a wooden box to mount and hold all our pneumatic components and the BVM. We also used a sponge to cushion our piston’s head such that it wouldn’t puncture the BVM. 
</li>
<li>
Portability: Our current design is portable and light-weight. It is designed to afford compactness such that it requires minimal space on board the ambulance. We decoupled elements of the automation mechanism into stationary and dynamic parts. Only the pneumatic cylinder and BVM will be in close proximity to the patient, whereas, the rest of the elements will be positioned at a fixed location most suitable to the ambulance infrastructure. 
</li>
<li>
Size: Decoupling various subfunctions of our mechanism helped us  make the size smaller and the setup less intrusive.
</li>
<li>
Compression: The current implementation affords complete compression of the self-inflating bag by meeting the minimum thrust requirements. Complete compression ensures sufficient oxygen/air reaches the patient’s lungs.
</li>
</ul>

Although we are an agile team, for the winter semester we modified our project management style, using a waterfall-agile hybrid approach for the alpha release, and an agile approach for the beta and final release.  
The alpha release consisted of researching and designing the mechanism that would pump the BVM.  The research was done with specially designated research sprints, while the design was done through consultation with advisors.  
Details of the alpha release roadmap can be found here. 

Here is a snapshot of the Alpha release Sprint Planning board:

The beta release had to be modified due to delays in the shipments of parts. The original beta release plan entailed completing the assembly of the device. This was changed to completing the design of the parts that had arrived by the beta release deadline: the Rasberry Pi, and the RPi Relay board.  Additionally it included designing and 3D printing the mount for the Cylinder which compressed the bag.  We formulated sprints to complete these tasks, and allocated the tasks according to team members availability and skill sets.  
Details of the beta release roadmap can be found here.

The final release consisted of assembling and testing out the final design.  Once we received the parts, we ran a sprint to allocate assignments for each task.

Work Distribution
Creating an even work distribution was one of the challenges of the capstone project. Although we had strategies that helped balance out the work somewhat ultimately at different points in the project the work distribution was skewed/non-uniform. We used an agile project management style. The assigned product owner created tasks on the asana and the scrum master assigned the task according to the team members' access to resources in terms of access to the advisors,communication with stakeholders and physical access to the components of the product. 

Since the assembly could only be done in one household and congregating to assemble the parts was not possible due to COVID-19 restrictions, the responsibility of assembling the parts would often fall on one group member.  This happened for both the MVP and the final product assembly, and made it very challenging for group members to do work concurrently.  To support the group members doing assembly, other group members would take on other responsibilities, such as buying and delivering various components for the product.  We would also occasionally ferry the parts back and forth between households, according to the availability of each team member. For example, the electrical components for the final design were assembled at one house, while the final assembly took place at another.   In an ideal world it would be possible for each group member to have their own prototype to work on, or it would be possible to work together on one prototype in one location.  Unfortunately fate was not on our side in this regard.
