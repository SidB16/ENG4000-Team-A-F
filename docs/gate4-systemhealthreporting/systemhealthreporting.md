### About Summary
Alpha release of a system health reporting application, utilizing XBee transceivers and Raspberry Pi3 to create a mesh network that uses peer-to-peer communication- visualizing and presenting the data transmitted within the nework as information, on a web-based dashboard.

### Background- What is this piece about and Why?
At of the start of the winter semester, our team decided to split into two-subteams. One dealing with the pump device, and the other dealing with failure reporting and visualizing system health. I took ownership of the latter.

In this part of the project, under the supervision of Professor.Franz Newland, Iâ€™m building a robust mechanism to collect health data of the automated BVM system. The end-goal is to share this data with the ambulance crew, and the base station personnel that monitor the health of the system.

### Product Vision- What is this piece of project doing?
This product is:
* Providing mechanism to report issues.
* Providing a low cost, mesh based communication. Allowing others abumblances to support a crew that might have fault.
* Provide a way to visualize data as gathered.

At the moment there is no automated reporting of device failures in an Ambulance operating in Gujarat, India. Thus, there is a need for automated failure reporting for mobile medical devices, used in various medical fields.

In essence, through this solution, the ambulance crew does not need to manually report/call-in a failure to the basestation personael.  
Furthermore, it allows one ambulance crew to support another, incase one experiences fault. The value is: if a automated BVM fails then a  higher load is placed on the crew, on top of pressure of caring for patients. This solutions minimizes the high workload placed on the ambulance crew- allowing them to focus on their patient. 

### Planned Releases
Beta Release- March 29th.
Final Release- April 12th.

### Application Architecture

**Figure1 shows the architecture of the system health reporting application as of it's Alpha release.**

### Configuration Management
In this project, a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and Dell Optiplex 7010 desktop are used as a the "ambulance" and "basestation", respectively. The key is transmission mode of the XBee transiver, to which the Pi or PC is connected too. Below I detail the hardware and software configuration of the Pi and the PC.

As of the Alpha release, software configurations are primarily minimal. However, towards the Beta release, configuration files will be created that contain code-based configurations in a single space- modulated away from data transmission source code. 

### Testing
### Testing the Mesh Network using XCTU

### Testing Sending and Receving data using Python3
As of this Alpha release, a manual testing strategy is used. A Python3 script written on the sender side, and receiver side to send and receive data.

**Figure4 shows how the Python3 scripts are used to test sending and receiving of data.**

### Results
This section contains three subsection that demonstrate the results of this Alpha Release. 

### 1) Raw Data Processed at the Basestation

**Figure5 shows the first build- version 1.0 where instead of generic database, a .txt file was used to store messages.**

### 2) Processed Data Visualized Real-time

**Figure6 shows the final build of the Alpha Release- data collected, processed and stored into a generic data-store on the Cloud. This spreadsheet is live. Please feel to scroll :)**

### 3) Data Presented Real-time
These two figures illustrate how the data collected can be visualized, and then presented on a website. This feature to embed visualizations will be used in the Beta release for better presentation of information.
