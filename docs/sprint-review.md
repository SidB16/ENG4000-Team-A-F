# Sprint Review 

The review meeting will take place on Sundays(biweekly) for an hour, after the end of each Sprint, in the
spirit of keeping these meetings concise. During this meeting the product owner will walk the
team through what is “done” and “not done” on the backlog. Thereafter, each member of the
team will demonstrate what they have worked on for that sprint and answer questions on
why they chose to design/implement things that way. These demos will allow us to
appreciate the work everyone is putting in and make meaningful inquiries.

Following the demos, we can review the key delivery metrics to determine if we are inline
with or deviating from our “Story Narrative” leading up to that sprint. In case we are
deviating, we as a collective(Stakeholder feedbacks included) can decide whether we need
to course correct or if the deviation is indeed a better alternative.

Finally, after looking into key metrics and the product, we can ellaborate on what
comes next. This would be a good time to evaluate whether the existing story points need to
be updated/modified to reflect the improvised “Story Narrative”, resulting in a revised backlog
which will then be used for the next Sprint.
